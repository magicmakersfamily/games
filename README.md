# The Game Shelf

Learning games for curious kids, published with GitHub Pages:
**https://magicmakersfamily.github.io/games/**

Every game is a self-contained static web page (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). There is no
server, no build step and no tracking. Progress is saved in each player's own browser
(`localStorage`).

Past versions stay playable at https://magicmakersfamily.github.io/games/versions/ (for
grown-ups; each keeps its own saved games). Every release is also a git tag (`blow-up-v1.3`, …).

## Adding a game

1. Put it in its own folder, with an `index.html` and a `cover.png` (1200×744).
2. Add a link back to the shelf (`<a href="../">← All games</a>`).
3. Add an `<article class="game">` card to the root `index.html`, with a version line:
   `<p class="version"><b>Version 1.0</b> · Launched <time datetime="YYYY-MM-DD">Month D, YYYY</time></p>`.
   The launch date never changes; bump the version on each release (on the card and at the
   bottom of the game page).
4. Commit and push to `main`. GitHub Pages redeploys in about a minute.
